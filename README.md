## <span style="color:blue">Introduction</span>
Welcome to the Cub3D 42 Network Project! This project is a captivating introduction to the world of raycasting and creating a simple 3D game engine, inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D. Cub3D is a part of the 42 Network's curriculum and is designed to challenge your programming skills while providing an exciting learning experience.

## <span style="color:blue">Project Description</span>
Cub3D is a network project that involves creating a raycasting game engine from scratch using the C programming language. The goal of this project is to build a 3D world rendered in a 2D map, where you navigate through a maze, similar to the gameplay of Wolfenstein 3D. You will be responsible for creating a game engine that can render walls, sprites, and handle player movement in a simple 3D environment.

This project covers various fundamental concepts of computer graphics and game development, such as raycasting, texture mapping, and player controls. By completing Cub3D, you will gain a solid understanding of how graphics engines work and develop strong programming skills in C.

## <span style="color:blue">Parsing</span>
The first part of the project involves parsing the map file that contains information about the game's configuration, such as the map layout, textures, and colors. The parsing process involves reading the map file, validating its contents, and storing the information in a data structure that can be used by the game engine.

## Getting Started

### <span style="color:blue">Prerequisites</span>
Before you start working on the Cub3D project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- **C Compiler**: A C compiler like GCC.
- **Make**: The `make` build tool.
- **MinilibX**: The graphical library provided by 42 for this project.

### <span style="color:blue">Installation</span>
1. Clone the Cub3D repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/emohamedd/cub3D.git
   ```
   ```shell
   cd cub3d 
   ```

   ```shell
   make
   ```
   <span style="color:blue">Usage</span>
    To run the Cub3D game, execute the following command:
   ```shell
   ./cub3D path_to_map.cub
   ```
    Replace path_to_map.cub with the path to your map file. The map file contains information about the game's configuration, such as the map layout, textures, and colors.

    <span style="color:blue">Controls</span>
    W: Move forward
    A: Rotate left
    S: Move backward
    D: Rotate right
    Right Arrow: Rotate camera right
    Left Arrow: Rotate camera left
    Esc: Exit the game
